title: Rapid Editor
---

In collaberation with our friends over at Rapid, we've integrated a way for you to submit map edits within MapRoulette instead of being directed to a separate application.

The Rapid Editor is available on most Challenge Task pages.  Simply start a task and within the Map Widget, click on the "Edit Mode" toggle.  You'll now be able to make your edit using the widget, without need to go to a separate web page.

The Rapid integration will be your default Map widget unless you switch back to "Classic Mode".

**Please note the Rapid Editor is currently not available for Cooperative or Tag-fix challenges**
