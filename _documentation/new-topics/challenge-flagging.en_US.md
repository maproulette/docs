title: Challenge Flagging
---

Challenge flagging allows mappers to report any questionable encounters within a challenge that did not meet quality standards.

See original post and credits on our blog [here](https://blog.maproulette.org/2023/01/23/introducing-our-flag-report-a-challenge-feature/)!

**Please be aware that Challenge Flagging is one of a set of features that assists mappers with reaching out to challenge owners.  Flagging a challenge may not be necessary, so please review the list of features and our recommendations for [Reporting A Challenge](/en-US/documentation/reporting-a-challenge) depeding on your specific needs.**

Upon coming across something we want to flag in a challenge, go to the challenge details page that belongs to the challenge, there you will be able to see a flag icon next to the challenge name.

Simply click on the flag icon, an email modal will appear to flag this challenge. Please include your email address, a flag description, and make sure you check \[I have attempted to contact the challenge creator\] before proceed. Click on the \[Flag Challenge\] button to submit a flag. This will open an issue in MapRoulette’s [challenge-reports repository](https://github.com/maproulette/challenge-reports/issues) on GitHub and generate a message in the comment section of this challenge.

Please note that only logged in user is able to flag a challenge. And if an issue has already been flagged by a user, we can only flag the same challenge again once that issue has been resolved.

We hope flag feature will help maintain and improve the overall quality of challenges on MapRoulette by passing our users abilities to regulate.
