title: Solving Multiple Tasks Together
---

Many MapRoulette Challenges have Tasks that are geographically so close together that it is more efficient to solve multiple close Tasks together as if it were one Task. MapRoulette offers a workflow for this since version 3.4.2.

To use the Multiple Tasks workflow, you need to add the **Multi-Task Work** Widget to your Task screen. To do this, click _Edit Layout_ in the right top corner of your Task screen, and use the _Add Widget_ dropdown menu to add add it to your Layout.

You may want to [create a separate Layout](/documentation/using-layouts/) just for Multi-Task work to further optimize your mapping workflow. Here's an example where you see the Multi-Task Widget and the regular Map Widget side by side. Such a Layout allows you to see the Task you've been assigned, while at the same time having visibility on other Tasks that are close together:

The Multi-Task window lets you select multiple tasks either using the Task list or by clicking the markers on the minimap. Here we have a few tasks that are close together selected:

The Task Completion section will now offer two options, either _Complete Together_ or _Cancel Selection_. If you click _Complete Together_, the Task map will show all the task features that you selected in the Multi-Task Widget, the separate Tasks are now bundled into one Task.

Solving this Bundled Task works the same as solving a single Task. If you change your mind, the Multi-Task Widget offers the option to Unbundle the Tasks.
