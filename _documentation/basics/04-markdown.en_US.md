title: Styling Text with Markdown
---

MapRoulette supports a variant of Markdown for marking up or styling text. Markdown can be used in most places where long-form text can be entered, such as task comments, challenge descriptions, challenge instructions, etc.

The variant supported by MapRoulette is inspired by [Github-flavor Markdown](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) (often abbreviated as GFM). Most -- though not all -- GFM is supported by MapRoulette. One notable exception: whereas GFM allows some raw HTML, MapRoulette does not.

Below is screenshot showing some commonly used bits of Markdown on the left, with a preview on the right of how that Markdown will appear to users:
